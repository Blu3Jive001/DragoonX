## A relook into the famous [Dragoon suite](https://www.deviantart.com/kalam1ty-ac/art/Dragoon-II-Unofficial-Release-686446226) for Windows 7

A makeover of sorts for the famous theme, making it functional for my setup, and sharing it with you. 

### What did I do?

+ Updated apps functionalities to work better/actually for Windows 10
+ Recoded Litestep into Rainmeter and Xoblite
+ Restyled Niivu's [DragoonX](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/Dragoon-X-687204548) theme to work better for 20H2
+ Included Winaero tweaks for enhanced Windows peformance

#### Update
Created a Firefox css for it! You can find it [here](https://github.com/Blu3Jive001/DragoonFox)

### Plans for the future?

+ Expand my theme tweak to work for NA (no-addressbar) *without* AHK help
+ Include a settings menu for Rainmeter code, for user-end customization ease
+ Entirely recode Rainmeter taskbar to Electron for less system resource usage

### Apps I used:

+ [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder)
+ [SumatraPDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html)
+ [Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/)
+ [Xoblite](http://xoblite.net/docs/)
