## A relook into the famous [Dragoon suite](https://www.deviantart.com/kalam1ty-ac/art/Dragoon-II-Unofficial-Release-686446226) for Windows 7

A makeover of sorts for the famous theme, making it functional for my setup, and sharing it with you. 

### What did I do?

+ Updated apps functionalities to work better/actually for Windows 10
+ Recoded Litestep into Rainmeter and Xoblite
+ Restyled Niivu's [DragoonX](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/art/Dragoon-X-687204548) theme to work better for 20H2
+ Also tweaked the theme to look like the original Dragoon-UI
+ Added a matching Firefox css

#### Update
Created a Firefox css for it! You can find it [here](https://github.com/Blu3Jive001/DragoonFox)

### Apps I used:

+ [Cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder)
+ [QTabBar](http://qttabbar.wikidot.com/)
+ [Foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/)
+ [Xoblite](http://xoblite.net/docs/)

## A big thanks to

+ [Kalamity](https://www.deviantart.com/kalam1ty-ac) for the original suite
+ [Niivu](https://www.deviantart.com/niivu/gallery) for creating the Windows theme
+ [Angelessey](https://www.deviantart.com/angelessey/art/night-52-877146763) for inspiring me
+ And you for looking here :)

#### A note on installation

I have included all the necessary files to theme Windows to look like the picture above.
However, I will include no tutorial on how to do so, there a much better ones on the internet, and I do not have the time to do so.
You may find some files missing, the majority of those are within Niivu's DragoonX theme pack.
